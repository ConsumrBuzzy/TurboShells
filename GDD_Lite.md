Game Design Document: Turbo ShellsVersion: 1.0 (MVP)Date: November 22, 2025Engine: Python / PyGameGenre: Management Simulation / Auto-Racer1. OverviewTurbo Shells is a management simulation where the player breeds, trains, and races a stable of turtles. The core gameplay loop revolves around managing the genetics of your flock, balancing the risk of betting on races, and deciding when to retire a champion to breed the next generation of super-racers.The Hook"Tamagotchi meets Horse Racing." You don't drive the turtle; you coach it.2. Core Gameplay LoopManagement Phase: Train turtles to improve stats or rest them to recover energy. Buy new stock from the shop.Race Phase: Enter a turtle into a procedural race. Bet on the outcome. Watch the race unfold automatically with speed controls.Breeding Phase: Retire aging turtles to the breeding pool. Combine two retirees to create a superior offspring, freeing up space for the cycle to continue.3. The Systems3.1 The Roster SystemThe player has a strict limit on inventory to force strategic decisions.Active Roster (Max 3): Turtles currently training and racing.Retired Roster (Max 3): Turtles that have finished their career. They cannot race or train; they exist solely for breeding.Inventory Management: To acquire a new turtle (via Shop or Breeding), the player must have an empty Active Slot. This requires releasing or retiring existing turtles.3.2 Turtle Stats (The DNA)Every turtle is an object defined by the following parameters:StatDescriptionEffect in RaceSpeedBase VelocityHow many pixels the turtle moves per frame on flat ground (Grass).EnergyGas TankDrains as the turtle moves. Higher Energy = longer running time before resting.RecoveryRest SpeedHow fast Energy refills when the turtle is exhausted (stopped).SwimTerrain ModSpeed multiplier when traversing Water segments.ClimbTerrain ModSpeed multiplier when traversing Rock segments.AgeLifespanIncreases by 1 every Race. At Day 100, the turtle is forced into Retirement.3.3 The Race Logic (Auto-Battler)The race is an automated side-scroller. The player observes and controls only the simulation speed.Running State: The turtle moves forward at Current_Speed. Energy drains at a rate based on terrain difficulty.Exhaustion: If Energy <= 0, the turtle stops moving (Speed = 0).Recovery State: The turtle remains stationary. Energy regenerates based on the Recovery stat.Resume: Once Energy >= 50%, the turtle resumes running.Race Controls:1x (Normal Speed)2x (Fast Forward)4x (Turbo)3.4 Breeding (The Progression)Breeding is the primary method of stat growth across generations.Requirement: 2 Retired Turtles + 1 Empty Active Slot.Cost: The 2 Parent turtles are permanently deleted (Sacrificed).Formula:PythonBaby_Stat = ((ParentA_Stat + ParentB_Stat) / 2) + Random_Mutation
Mutation is a random value between -2 and +5 to allow for gradual improvement.3.5 Economy & TrainingCurrency: Money ($).Starting Funds: $50.Income:Prize: $5 guaranteed (Participation) + Bonus for winning.Bets: Player wagers $0–$100. Returns (Bet * Odds) on win.Expenses:Shop: Buying Gen-1 turtles.Gym Upgrades: One-time costs to improve training efficiency.Training Cost: Training does not cost money. It costs Energy. This allows players to grind stats even if they go bankrupt.4. User Interface (UI) ArchitectureScreen 1: The Stable (Main Menu)Dashboard: Displays the 3 Active Slots.Slot Info: Name, Age, Energy Bar, Stats Summary.Buttons per Slot: [TRAIN], [REST], [RETIRE].Global Buttons: [GO TO RACES], [OPEN SHOP], [BREEDING CENTER].Screen 2: The Race TrackVisuals: 3 Horizontal Lanes.Lane 1: Player Turtle.Lane 2-3: CPU Opponents (Randomly generated stats).HUD: Race Distance Progress Bar, Speed Control Toggles.Pre-Race Modal: "Place your Bet: [$_______]"Screen 3: The ShopInventory: 3 Randomly generated "Gen-1" turtles.Pricing: Total_Stats * $1.5.Refresh: Button to reroll shop inventory ($5 cost).5. Technical Scope (MVP)Assets NeededSprites (Placeholders acceptable):Turtle (Running frame, Resting frame).Terrain Tiles: Grass (Green), Water (Blue), Rock (Grey).Data Structures:roster_list: List of objects.retired_list: List of objects.ControlsMouse: UI interaction (Clicking buttons).Keyboard:1, 2, 3: Race speed control.ESC: Return to Main Menu.6. Future Expansion (Post-MVP)Triathlons: Multi-stage races requiring balanced stats.Weather: Rain affects Rock climb speed; Heat affects Energy drain.Equipment: Hats or shells that boost specific stats.Personalities: Hidden traits (e.g., "Lazy" = recovers fast but drains energy fast).
