Game Design Document: Turbo ShellsVersion: 1.0 (MVP)Date: November 22, 2025Engine: Python / PyGameGenre: Management Simulation / Auto-Racer1. Executive SummaryTurbo Shells is a management simulation where the player acts as a trainer for a stable of racing turtles. Unlike arcade racers, the player does not control the movement directly. Instead, they manage the genetics, training, and energy of their flock.The core hook is the "Sacrificial Breeding" system: to create the next generation of champions, you must retire and lose your current ones, creating a constant cycle of risk and reward.2. Core Gameplay LoopManage: Check the Active Roster. Train turtles to improve stats (costing Energy) or Rest them (costing Time).Race: Enter a turtle into a procedurally generated event. Bet on the outcome. Watch the race unfold and manage the simulation speed.Profit: Win money from bets and prizes. Use money to buy new genetic stock from the Shop.Evolve: Retire aging champions. Breed them to produce superior offspring, freeing up roster slots for the new generation.3. Game Systems3.1 The Roster SystemThe player is strictly limited to 3 Active Slots. This scarcity forces strategic decision-making.Active Roster (Max 3):These turtles can Train and Race.They age every race/training session.Constraint: You cannot buy or breed a new turtle if all 3 slots are full.Retired Roster (Max 3):Turtles moved here are permanently retired from racing.They exist solely as "Genetic Donors" for breeding.Once used for breeding, they are removed from the game.3.2 Turtle Stats (The DNA)Every turtle is an object defined by the following parameters:StatDescriptionGameplay ImpactSpeedBase VelocityPixels moved per frame on flat ground (Grass).EnergyStamina PoolThe fuel tank. Drains while moving.RecoveryRegenerationHow fast Energy refills when the turtle is exhausted/stopped.SwimWater SkillSpeed multiplier (0.1x to 1.5x) when traversing Water.ClimbRock SkillSpeed multiplier (0.1x to 1.5x) when traversing Rock.AgeLifespanIncreases by 1 per event. At Day 100, the turtle must retire.3.3 The Race Logic (Energy Mechanics)The race is an automated side-scroller. The physics are deterministic based on stats.Running Phase:Turtle moves at Current_Speed.Energy drains at a rate of 0.5 * Terrain_Difficulty.Exhaustion Phase:If Energy <= 0, the turtle Stops completely.Status changes to "Resting."Recovery Phase:While stopped, Energy increases by Recovery_Stat * 0.1.Once Energy >= 50% of Max, the turtle resumes Running.Design Note: This creates a strategy where a slow turtle with high Recovery might beat a fast turtle that gasses out halfway.3.4 Breeding (The Progression)Breeding is the only way to get "Super Turtles" that exceed the stats of shop-bought basics.Requirements:Two turtles in the Retired Roster.One empty slot in the Active Roster.The Cost: The two parents are deleted from the game (Sacrifice).The Outcome: A new Baby Turtle is generated.Formula:PythonBaby_Stat = ((ParentA_Stat + ParentB_Stat) / 2) + Mutation
(Mutation is a random float between -2.0 and +5.0)3.5 EconomyCurrency: Money ($).Income:Prize: $5 (Participation) to $50 (1st Place).Betting: Player can wager $0–$100. Return = Bet + (Bet * Odds).Training Cost: Training costs Energy, not Money. (Allows broke players to grind).Shop: Buying generic "Gen-1" turtles to fill roster gaps. Cost scales with stats.4. User Interface (UI) ArchitectureScreen 1: The Stable (Main Menu)Visual: Displays 3 vertical slots.Slot UI:Name, Age (Day X/100).Energy Bar (Green).Stat Block (Speed/Swim/Climb/Rec).Action Buttons: [TRAIN], [REST], [RETIRE].Navigation: Buttons to switch to [RACE MENU] or [SHOP].Screen 2: The Race ViewVisual: 3 Horizontal Lanes (Side-scrolling).Lane 1: Player Turtle.Lane 2 & 3: AI Opponents.Terrain Visualization: Green Rects (Grass), Blue Rects (Water), Grey Rects (Rock).HUD:Speed Controls: [1x] [2x] [4x].Distance Bar: Percentage to finish line.Screen 3: The ShopInventory: 3 Randomly generated turtles.Actions: [BUY] (moves to Active Roster), [REFRESH] (Costs $5).5. Controls (Inputs)Mouse: Primary input for Menu navigation and selection.Keyboard Shortcuts:R: Go to Race (Debug/Shortcut).M: Return to Menu.1, 2, 3: Control Race Speed (1x, 2x, 4x).ESC: Quit Application.6. Technical Implementation Details (MVP)Language: Python 3.10+Library: PyGame Community Edition (pygame-ce) or Standard PyGame.State Management: Simple State Machine (current_state string variable).Data Persistence: None for MVP (Reset on close).Class Structure (Simplified)Pythonclass Turtle:
    # Handles stats, movement logic, and drawing its own sprite
    def update(self): ...
    def draw(self): ...

class Game:
    # Handles the main loop, input events, and state switching
    def run(self): ...
7. Future Expansion (Post-MVP)Triathlons: Multi-stage races that require a generalist turtle.Visual Polish: Animated sprites for running/swimming/climbing.Gym Upgrades: Spend money to increase the stat gain per training session.Save System: JSON or Pickle serialization to save the stable.
